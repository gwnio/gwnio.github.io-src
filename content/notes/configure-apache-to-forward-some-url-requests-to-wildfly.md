I created a website ([CheapThyCable.com](https://www.cheapthycable.com){:target="_blank"}) that is composed of a static blog and a JavaEE application.  Originally I developed it so that all content was served out by the application server whose content was comprised from a war file.

When I originally built the project, I wanted everything to be contained in my war file, both dynamic content and static content.  A couple of things I have since discovered I don't like about this are 1) any blogs I add requires a war file deployment which is much slower than just doing a apache restart, 2) I didn't like the effect this had on my version control.  For me, it was difficult to determine when a good time to perform a tag on the source code should occur, since things were constantly changing with the blog.

So I decided that I wanted to separate the content of my website and particularly what served out that content.  The site's blog is generated by the static site generator Pelican and all this content I wanted to be served out by the Apache web server.  All other content, namely the application, would be handle by my Wildfly application server.  Below is a brief snippet from my httpd.conf file, showing how I forwarded certain application related url patterns to the application server.

A couple of quick notes.  Under my htdocs folder, I created a subfolder _cheapthycable.com_ containing the static content served out by Apache.  My application server is listening on port 8080, so by specifying the port I can forward request on to the application server.  Also notice the use of ProxyPassReverse.  You may ask, "do I need the ProxyPassReverse".  The documentation recommends it.

> The reverse proxy then decides where to send those requests and returns the content as if it were itself the origin.

and

> Note that whether you use RewriteRule or ProxyPass, you'll still need to use the ProxyPassReverse directive to catch redirects issued from the back-end server:

I won't include all the app related urls that need to be forwarded, but a couple are _/login_ and _/app_.

This is a just a snippet of my base configuration, but should give you a basic idea.
